                  LONG_W         NUMBER
                  
            Where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

      select count(city)-count(distinct(city)) from station;
      
   # 4 write a query to display two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
   # If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically

   # 8 write a query to display list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
      select distinct(city) from station where left(city,1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');
      
   # 9 write a query to display list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates. 
      select distinct(city) from station where right(city,1) not in('a','e','i','o','u');
      
   # 10 write a query to display list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
